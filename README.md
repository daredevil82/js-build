## Javascript Build System Demonstration

A demonstration project to showcase the uses of Gulp, Grunt and Webpack for an Angular project.

Gulp and Grunt will use Angular 1.5.x, and Webpack will use Angular 2.0.x RC.  Each will have their own branch and be self-sufficient.

To access each demonstration, simply check out the appropriate branch

  * Gulp `git checkout gulp`
  * Grunt `git checkout grunt`
  * Webpack `git checkout webpack`
  
and follow the instructions in the README.

Before doing all this, you should ensure the latest stable version of `node` 
and `npm` are installed on your system.  Execute `sudo npm install -g gulp grunt webpack babel typescript` at the command prompt
 to install global dependencies.  All other dependencies will be installed by the branch's `package.json` file
